Vibrating watchface. 

The minutes are expressed with four vibrations, three of short and one long. The placement of the long vibration signals the minutes. The minutes are followed by a long pause and then vibrations of equal length, one for each hour: 

So if the time is 3:45, it's signaled as follows: short, short, short, long, pause. one, two, three. 

THE MINUTES ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
XX:00 窶ネong, short, short, short. 
XX:15 窶ピhort, long, short, short. 
XX:30 窶ピhort, short, long, short. 
XX:45 窶ピhort, short, short, long. 

The hours are based on a 12-hour clock. 

The current version of the watchface starts at 8:00 am and ends at midnight. I'm currently working on customization and the possibility of muting the watchface. Stay tuned.
